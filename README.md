## Management Tool

I am currently building a project management tool that will allow a user to monitor company projects and tickets associated with those projects through
the life of the project.

My goal is to create comprehensive style project that will demonstrate my capabilities across multiple areas. These areas will include but are not limited
to UX design, Databases, API's, and algorithms. 

For the database I have decided to use a MySQL through AWS.

I will use Docker for the first time which will give the program portability between machines.
